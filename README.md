# Empathia Protocol

Welcome to Empathia, the global volunteering community powered by web3 technology!

Our mission is to create a decentralized platform that revolutionizes the way volunteering is registered, promoted, and recognized. By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology, we aim to empower volunteers, organizations, communities, and enterprises to come together and make a positive impact on the world.

With Empathia, you can easily register as a volunteer with one or more organizations or communities, and verify your volunteering experiences to earn tokens. These tokens can then be exchanged for goods and services provided by supporting organizations or enterprises, creating a unique ecosystem where your efforts are truly valued and rewarded.

As a non-profit team, we are grateful to be supported by esteemed advisors and institutions from the humanitarian and web3 communities. Currently, we are in the process of testing a web2 prototype with select social impact organizations and volunteers, while also seeking funds to develop our web3 protocol and dapp.

Join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the world of volunteering and make a lasting positive impact with Empathia!
